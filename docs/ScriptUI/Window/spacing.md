Window.spacing {#Window.spacing}
==============

> [Number]{role="ref"} **spacing**

Description
-----------

The number of pixels separating one child element from its adjacent
sibling element.

Because each container holds only a single row or column of children,
only a single spacing value is needed for a container. The default value
is based on the type of container, and is chosen to match standard Adobe
UI guidelines.
