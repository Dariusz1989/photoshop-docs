   :ref:`Boolean` **active**


Description
-----------

Set to true to make this window active.

A modal dialog that is visible is by definition the active dialog.             An active palette is the front-most window.                            An active control is the one with focus-that is, the one that accepts keystrokes, or in the case of aÂ Button, be selected when the user types  Return or Enter.
