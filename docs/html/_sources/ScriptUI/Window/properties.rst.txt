When true, the title bar includes a button to close the window, if the platform and window type allow it. When false, it does not. Default is true. Not used for dialogs.              maximizeButton: Bridge only. When true, the title bar includes a button to expand the window to its maximum size (typically, the entire screen), if the platform and window type allow it. When false, it does not. Default is false for type palette, true for type window. Not used for dialogs.
