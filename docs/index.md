Photoshop Scripting & Extension Reference
=========================================

The primary goal of this site was to combine all resources related to
scripting and extending Photoshop. There are many resources if you know
where to look, but getting the big picture is sometimes difficult.
Anyhow, hopefully this will shed some light on this love-hate
relationship.
