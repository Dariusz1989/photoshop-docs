Description
-----------

When the parent is a multi-column?ListBox, this describes the labels for this selectable row in additional columns.

A array of JavaScript objects whose length is one less than the number of columns. The first member describes the label in the second column. Each member object has two properties, of which you can specify one or both:                            text: A display string for the corresponding label.                                         image: An?ScriptUIImage?object for the corresponding label.
