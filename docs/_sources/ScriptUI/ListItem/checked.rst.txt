   :ref:`Boolean` **checked**


Description
-----------

The checked state of an item in a list.

When true, the item is marked with the platform-appropriate checkmark. When false, no checkmark is drawn, but space is reserved for it in the left margin, so that the item lines up with other checkable items. When undefined, no space is reserved for a checkmark.
