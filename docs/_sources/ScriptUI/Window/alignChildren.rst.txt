   :ref:`String` **alignChildren**


Description
-----------

Tells the layout manager how unlike-sized children of this container should be aligned within a column or row.

Order of creation determines which children are at the top of a column or the left of a row; the earlier a child is created, the closer it is to the top or left of its column or row. If defined, alignment for a child element overrides the alignChildren setting for the parent container. See alignment property for values.
