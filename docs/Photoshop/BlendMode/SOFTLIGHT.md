BlendMode.SOFTLIGHT {#BlendMode.SOFTLIGHT}
===================

> int **SOFTLIGHT**

Description
-----------

Darkens or lightens the colors, depending on the blend color. The effect
is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the image. If the blend
color (light source) is lighter than 50% gray, the image is lightened as
if it were dodged. If the blend color is darker than 50% gray, the image
is darkened as if it were burned in. Painting with pure black or white
produces a distinctly darker or lighter area but does not result in pure
black or white.
