==============================

> int **NEARESTNEIGHBOR**

Description
-----------

Chooses a pixel in the center of the sample area and replaces the entire
area with that pixel color. Same as subsampling.

Significantly reduces the conversion time compared with downsampling but
results in images that are less smooth and continuous.
