ColorBlendMode.DIFFERENCE {#ColorBlendMode.DIFFERENCE}
=========================

> int **DIFFERENCE**

Description
-----------

Looks at the color information in each channel and subtracts either the
blend color from the base color or the base color from the blend color,
depending on which has the greater brightness value. Blending with white
inverts the base color values; blending with black produces no change.
