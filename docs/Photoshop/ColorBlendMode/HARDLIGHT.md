ColorBlendMode.HARDLIGHT {#ColorBlendMode.HARDLIGHT}
========================

> int **HARDLIGHT**

Description
-----------

Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the blend color. The
effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the image. If the
blend color (light source) is lighter than 50% gray, the image is
lightened, as if it were screened. This is useful for adding highlights
to an image. If the blend color is darker than 50% gray, the image is
darkened, as if it were multiplied. This is useful for adding shadows to
an image. Painting with pure black or white results in pure black or
white.
